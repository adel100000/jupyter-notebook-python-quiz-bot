#  Python Quiz Bot (Math & Physics Edition)

A simple quiz game built in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**, designed to help users practice **math** and **physics** concepts through interactive questions.

---

##  Overview
This project was an early experiment in combining Python logic with basic question randomization.  
The bot presents randomized math and physics problems, checks user input, and keeps track of the score â€” perfect for practicing fundamental STEM topics.

##  Features
-  **Randomized questions** for math, physics, and calculus  
-  **Automatic scoring system**  
-  **Covers** algebra, kinematics, and basic calculus  
-  **Expandable design** for adding new subjects or topics  



##  Future Improvements
-  Add a simple GUI (Tkinter or PyQt)  
-  Add a **timer** and **difficulty levels**  
-  Explore **multiplayer quiz mode**  



##  How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`quiz_bot.ipynb`) in any Python 3 environment.  
2. Run all cells to start the quiz.  
3. Answer the prompts directly in the notebook interface.  

Alternatively, if using a `.py` version:

```bash
python quiz_bot.py
